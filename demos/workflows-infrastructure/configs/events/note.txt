1. Open GH issue manually
  - Title: desired k8s version
  - Labels:
    - "upgrade"
    - "cluster/<name>"
    - "account/<aws_account>"
    - "approved"
2. Issue opened/updated actions triggers webhook to Argo Events
3. Argo Events creates workflow
  - Will require all labels above to run
4. Workflow runs:
  - Pre-checks
    - Checks that k8s version is valid
    - Checks that cluster name is valid
    - Checks that aws account is valid
    - Checks that desired k8s version is > current k8s version
  - IF pre-check failure:
    - Add comment to GH issue stating what failed
  - IF pre-check success:
    - Add comment to GH issue "Pre-checks passed. Upgrading now"
    - K8s upgrade control plane
    - K8s upgrade worker nodes (ami rotation?)
    - Validate upgrade (maybe try to deploy a workload?)
      - IF validation success:
        - Add comment to GH issue stating the cluster has been upgraded
        - Close GH issue
      - IF validation failure:
        - Add comment to GH issue stating validation failed and a manual fix is required

Other thoughts for the workflow:
- Will run in namespace that has a secret already in it for AWS authentication
- Will run in namespace that has a secret for the GH PAT to update the issue as well
